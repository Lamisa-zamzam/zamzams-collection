# Zamzam's Collection

## Exclusive football jerseys

This responsive project provides a number of jersey which you can buy. It also has [Firebase Authentication System](https://firebase.google.com/docs?authuser=0) for better user experience. You can create an account using email and password or Google. There is a card for each jersey and by clicking the order button, if you are logged in, you go to the checkout page and can order to buy it. Your data will be saved to the database [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/). Through the admin page, you are allowed to add, delete and edit any product. It contains special search feature so that you can easily find the jersey you want. You can see all the orders that you made on our website in the orders page. Last but not least, this website uses private routing form [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form validation.
